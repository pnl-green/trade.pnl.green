# Commenting Coverage Snapshot

This report identifies repository files that **have not** been touched by inline-commenting passes in the last few hours.
It compares the tracked files in the repository against the files changed in the recent commit window (`git log --since="4 hours ago"`).

## How the check was performed

```sh
git ls-files | sort -u > /tmp/all_files.txt
git log --since="4 hours ago" --name-only --pretty=format: | sort -u > /tmp/recent_files.txt
comm -23 /tmp/all_files.txt /tmp/recent_files.txt > /tmp/stale_files.txt
```

Files in `/tmp/stale_files.txt` have not seen edits (and therefore gained inline comments) in the inspected window.

## Summary of uncovered files

| Scope | Files without new inline comments |
| --- | ---: |
| `frontend` | 1,329 |
| `backend` | 8 |
| `.github` | 1 |
| Root `README.md` | 1 |

> **Note:** The frontend’s `public/` directory dominates the uncovered total (1,257 static asset files). Source gaps are concentrated in `frontend/src` (55 files), `frontend/utils` (7 files), and `frontend/types` (3 files).

## Representative file gaps

The following lists highlight code-centric areas that still need inline documentation attention:

### Backend
- `backend/.docker/Dockerfile.yaml`
- `backend/Cargo.toml`
- `backend/README.md`
- `backend/api.md`
- `backend/compose.yml`
- `backend/rust-toolchain.toml`

### Frontend source (top priorities)
- `frontend/src/components/**` (multiple React components remain undocumented)
- `frontend/src/styles/**` (shared styling modules lack inline context)
- `frontend/src/utils/**` (utility helpers untouched by recent passes)
- `frontend/src/types/**` (shared type definitions without commentary)

### Supporting assets
- `frontend/public/**` (static images and configuration JSON files; typically do not require inline comments)

## Next steps

1. Prioritise `frontend/src` modules—especially components and utilities—for the next commenting sprint.
2. Review remaining backend configuration files to determine whether high-level documentation or inline comments are warranted.
3. Use the command set above to re-run this check after each documentation batch to confirm coverage improvements.
