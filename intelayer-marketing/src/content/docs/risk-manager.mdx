# Risk Manager

Intelayerâ€™s semi-automatic risk manager sizes positions around a target max loss per trade. Enter your threshold once and every ticket respects it.

## How it works

1. Set your **Max Loss** amount (e.g., $500).
2. Define your stop distance or liquidation trigger.
3. Intelayer calculates the correct position size and adjusts quantity as price moves.

## Example math

```
Max loss = $500
Stop distance = 2%
Size = Max loss / Stop distance = $500 / 0.02 = $25,000 notionally
```

Intelayer rounds quantities to venue tick sizes and previews the numbers before submission.

## Edge cases

- If the required position is smaller than the venue minimum, Intelayer highlights the gap.
- For levered products, margin requirements are factored into the preview.
- Alerts trigger when consecutive trades approach your daily or weekly loss limits.
