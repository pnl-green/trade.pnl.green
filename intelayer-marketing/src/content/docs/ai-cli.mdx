# AI-CLI

The AI-CLI translates natural language into executable orders. It understands intents, conditions, and risk constraints without requiring code.

## Command patterns

- **Directional orders:** “Buy 10 BTC at the 4-hour 50 EMA.”
- **Conditional logic:** “Limit chase 1 BTC on 4-hour close above 51k.”
- **Risk constraints:** “Size so max loss is $500 if stop hits.”

## Safeguards

- Intelayer previews the parsed order before execution.
- Dry-run mode simulates fills without touching live balances.
- Invalid or ambiguous commands respond with human-readable clarifications.

## Tips

- Chain conditions with words like “then” or “after.”
- Reference spreads (e.g., “Long SOL, short MATIC with 2:1 ratio”).
- Call bots by name: “Update Atlas bot to use EMA crossover.”

## Examples

```tsx
intelayer> Buy 5 ETH if RSI(1h) crosses above 35 then trail stop 1.5%
intelayer> Hedge 2 BTC perpetual short if funding > 0.05%
intelayer> Alert me when BONK/DOGE spread widens by 3 std dev
```
