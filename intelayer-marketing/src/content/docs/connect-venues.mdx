# Connect Venues

Intelayer integrates with centralized exchanges (CEXs), decentralized exchanges (DEXs), and traditional brokerages. Connections use OAuth where available or API keys scoped to trading and read access.

## Centralized exchanges

| Venue | Auth method | Required scopes | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Coinbase Advanced | OAuth | trading, transfers | OAuth tokens auto-refresh. |
| Binance | API key | trade, read balance | Enable IP allowlists for extra safety. |
| Kraken | API key | trade, ledgers | Set withdrawal permissions to **off**. |

### API key creation checklist

1. Generate a new API key dedicated to Intelayer.
2. Disable withdrawal permissions.
3. Restrict by IP if the venue supports static allowlists.
4. Store the key in your password manager.

## Decentralized venues

- Connect wallets via WalletConnect or injected extensions.
- Intelayer signs orders locally and relays them to venue APIs; private keys never leave your device.
- For smart order routing, Intelayer requests read-only access to pool state.

## Brokerages

Intelayer supports equities and options via supported broker APIs. OAuth is used where possible; otherwise, create a limited-scope key with trade + balances access.

## Safety tips

- Rotate API keys every 90 days.
- Review venue dashboards for active Intelayer sessions.
- Enable multi-factor authentication on all accounts.
