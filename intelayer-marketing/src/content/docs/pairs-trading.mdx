# Pairs Trading

Intelayer lets you chart and execute custom crypto-vs-crypto spreads without third-party scripts.

## Constructing spreads

1. Choose the base asset (e.g., ETH).
2. Select the quote asset (e.g., BTC).
3. Optionally apply weightings such as 1.2x vs. 0.8x to balance volatility.

Intelayer normalizes historical prices and displays spread charts alongside DOM data for both legs.

## Execution flow

- Stage orders leg-by-leg or use the spread ticket for simultaneous routing.
- AI-CLI commands like “Long SOL, short MATIC with 2:1 ratio” prefill the spread ticket.
- Risk manager respects your max-loss constraint across both legs.

## Common pitfalls

- **Liquidity drift:** Thin books may cause slippage between legs; set tolerance bands.
- **Funding differentials:** Track perp funding or borrow rates for each venue.
- **Exchange downtime:** Route legs across multiple venues to avoid maintenance windows.
