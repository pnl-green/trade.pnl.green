# Security

Intelayer is designed for traders who demand tight operational security. The marketing site and terminal minimize data collection and emphasize client-side control.

## Key handling

- API keys remain encrypted in the browser and are only transmitted to the venue you authorize.
- OAuth tokens refresh via the venueâ€™s official APIs and are scoped to trading + balances.
- Hardware wallet support keeps private keys off hot machines.

## Client controls

- Content Security Policy defaults to `default-src 'self'` with explicit allowances for venue APIs.
- Frame embedding is disabled via `frame-ancestors 'none'`.
- No analytics load until a user toggles opt-in (stored locally).

## Incident response

- Intelayer publishes status updates on the Socials page if venue connectivity degrades.
- Automated monitoring flags abnormal API activity and prompts key rotation.
- Security disclosures can be sent to `security@intelayer.com` using PGP (fingerprint available on request).
