# Bots & Fees

Intelayer lets you deploy trading bots using plain English instructions. Define logic once, iterate, and ship to managed infrastructure with one click.

## Defining a bot

1. Open the AI-CLI and describe your strategy: “When BTC crosses above 4h 50 EMA, ladder buys every 0.2%.”
2. Intelayer previews triggers, order sizing, and guardrails.
3. Save the bot and assign venues plus allowed pairs.

## Monitoring

- Track PnL, win rate, and drawdowns from the Bots dashboard.
- Pause, edit, or clone bots without redeploying code.
- Alerts fire in-app, via email, or through Discord webhooks.

## Fees

- Intelayer charges **3 bps** on bot-executed volume.
- When a venue pays front-end rebates, Intelayer applies them against the fee.
- Where no rebate exists, Intelayer may charge a flat **2 bps** to cover infrastructure.

## Transparency

- Every fill includes a receipt showing venue fees and Intelayer’s fee share.
- Exportable logs keep compliance teams in the loop.
